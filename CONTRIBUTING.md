# Welcome to Geppetto

Thanks in taking interest in this project! The project is still in an early state, so there is more than enough work to improve this project.

## Things I personally would like to see improved

- Keyboard support
- General UX improvements like dragging items
- Strech mutation supporting radius as well
- Performance improvements when updating timelines
- Improved indication about 'consumed resources'
- Documentation
- Tests

PR's are welcome!

For me personally this project now does what I set out to do. Next step for me would be making an 'adventure game' engine that utilizes Geppetto. In the process I will ofcourse create animations for an upcoming game, so I will use this project for that, and improve where I can to make the drawing/designing process easier.
